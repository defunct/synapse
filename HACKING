SYNAPSE

Open Source Peer-to-Peer Micro-Sharing

TOOLSET

The code is Java. (A C++ implementation is rattling around my head.)

    Code: git (http://git.or.cz/)
    IDEs: Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/)
    Build: Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)

Install the above. I'm open to supporting addional IDEs, if someone
wants to share their NetBeans, IDEA, etc. configurations.

BUILD

Clone the git repostiory.

    git clone git://github.com/bigeasy/synapse.git synapse

Pull the dependencies.

    cd synapse
    mvn install
    
Launch Eclipse and add the Synapse project.

PATCHES

Synapse is shared via GitHub. You are more than welcome to fork a copy
and make changes to the code under the licensing terms.

If you make changes and would like to share them with me, you can drop
me a line at...

    alan@blogometer.com

I'm not imaginging much interest in the project at this point, so I'm
not sure how to merge contributions, or if my code base is the
authority. It will probably be based on the working relationship
established with the first person to suggest a patch.

CONTRIBUTIONS

Monitary contributions and support are always welcome.
